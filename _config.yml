  I am passionate about data. Whether itâ€™s Covid-19 data, my personal finances, or probabilities in my favourite board game "Dominion", I love looking at statistics, plotting trends, and making it meaningful. In the same vein, my professional background lies in data science, from collection to analysis. I am particularly interested in and experienced with physics-leveraged research projects, either as the primary focus or as a necessary tool.
